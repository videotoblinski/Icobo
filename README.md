I wrote Icobo in Visual Studio 2010, so I don't know if everything still works in .NET 6 or whatever's new.

Icobo is invoked from the command line like this:
> `icobo.exe "C:\Program Files\Program\Program.exe"`

Or, if you'd rather, you can drag and drop an application onto it and it will do everything for you.

After it's done ripping icons it will open the folder in Explorer. If it hits a snag, it will show you an error in Notepad. There is no GUI in this program.
